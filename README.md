# Mega Redone Rebirth Engine

This is a showcase of a Megaman engine made in Godot /Blazium that was created due to an earlier project of mine having an error.

Current Features:

1. Mega Man with charge shots, movement, and basic abilities.

2. Pause menu + main menu.

3. Enemy spawner system (enemy_spawner node).

4. Sample levels and enemies.

5. among others.

## Disclaimer



Keep in mind that this is basically a work in progress done for fun,so it might not be updated that often.

Also,it's a bit buggy too.

Just a warning.

Oh and this engine **is** a personal learning project, not a production-ready tool. Expect:

- Messy/overcomplicated code: Some parts were hacked together to "just work."

- Zero optimization: No fancy algorithms or performance tweaks yet.

- Spaghetti potential: I prioritized fun over clean architecture.

Please ask for permission from me first if you want to use this for your project.
