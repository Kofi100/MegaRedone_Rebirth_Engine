# Mega Redone Rebirth Engine

This is a Megaman engine made in Godot /Blazium that was created due to an earlier project of mine having an error.

Right now,it features:

-Megaman with his basic charging functions

-A Pause Menu

-A Main Menu

-Some enemies 

-A node(enemy_spawner) which can be used to respawn enemies.

-Some levels 

among others.

Keep in mind that this is basically a work in progress done for fun,so it might not be updated that often.

Also,it's a bit buggy too.

Just a warning.

Please ask for permission from me first if you want to use this for your project.
